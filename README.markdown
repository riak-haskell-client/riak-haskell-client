# Welcome to the Haskell Riak client

This library is a fast Haskell client for the
[Riak](http://www.basho.com/Riak.html) decentralized key/value data store.

It uses Riak's [protobuf API](http://wiki.basho.com/PBC-API.html) for
optimal performance.

This project was originally the work of Bryan O'Sullivan <bos@serpentine.com>, and is now being maintained by the engineering team of [Janrain, Inc.](http://janrain.com/).
